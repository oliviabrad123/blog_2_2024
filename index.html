            <h2>How psychedelics and VR could reveal how we become immersed in reality</h2>

            <p>This article depicts how psychedelics and VR could come together as one and be used as 
                research. Neuro Scientist Zues Tipado has been conducting an experiment to find out if it
                is possible to put together what goes on in a human's brain in it's daily function through
                testing studies on human's through drug induced experments on humans playing VR.

            <h2>What does it mean to trust a technology?</h2>

            <p>The majority of the public are still getting used to technology taking over and are in denial
                about some of the newer developing technologies in the field, wondering if they are able to put 
                their full trust into these projects. Purveyors are worried that if they don't gain public trust
                in the future, the new inventions will barely be used.

            <h2>Battery-like device made from water and clay could be used on Mars</h2>

            <p>Vasily Artenmov has helped to develop a sacecapitor design that is similar to the battery operated 
                one except his design uses clay and water as it's power. Their intention is to build more sustainable technologies. </p>
